Hi, welcome to my personal webpage!  

I'm Ignacio, a Biotechnology student at the State University of Milagro. I specialize in data analysis, experimental design, and science education. 

Currently, Iâ€™m working on research projects involving graphene and bioproducts, with a strong interest in applied statistics, bioinformatics, and interdisciplinary research.
